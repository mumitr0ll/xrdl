XRDL is to XML-RPC what WSDL is to SOAP: an automated client generation tool.

XRDL provides a way to create simple service definitions for XML-RPC services. XRDL is inspired by WSDL but aims for ease of use in the spirit of XML-RPC.

XRDL includes a number of tools, allowing automatic XRDL-generation for servers and clients written in php or C++/Qt.

Currently the only way to download XRDL is by cloning the mercurial repository.

Contributions are more than welcome - especially in the form of client-generators for one of the many XML-RPC libraries out there.

Please get in touch with me at soren@overgaard.org if you have questions or wish to contribute.
